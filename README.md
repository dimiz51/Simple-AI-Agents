# Building AI Agents
This repository holds some experiments I made with different Agentic AI frameworks such as :
- [smolagents](https://github.com/huggingface/smolagents)
- [LlamaIndex](https://www.llamaindex.ai/)

## Agents

### Smolagents
- [TAPLA-Travel-Planning-Agent](./TAPA-Travel-Planning-Agent/README.md): This simple Agent can use customized tools, making use of the [Amadeus API](https://developers.amadeus.com/) to achieve tasks such as:
    - Find available flights between two destination cities and figure out the best rates for a given date
    - Find the best available hotel deals on the destination city

### LlamaIndex
- [Youtube-Master-Agent](./Youtube-Master-Agent/README.md): This agent can transcribe youtube videos (provided with a video link), generate summaries and answer questions on the content of those videos.
